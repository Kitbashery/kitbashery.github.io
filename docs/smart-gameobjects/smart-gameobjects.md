## Description:
Smart GameObjects is a real-time visual scripting tool with built-in procedural animation and interactivity capabilities.

### Namespace:
Kitbashery.SmartGO

## Getting Started:
Right-click the hierarchy and navigate to Kitbashery > Smart GameObject
If a Smart Manager is not in the scene one will be automatically created.

Alternatively on an existing GameObject you can navigate to Add Component > Kitbashery > Gameplay > Smart GameObject and add it as a component.
Make sure there is a Smart Manager present in any scene with a SmartGameObject in it.

Instructions can be found by clicking on the (?) help button under the component's header and nearly every field will have a tooltip if you hover over it.
