# Getting Started:

### Creating a Smart GameObject:
Right-click the hierarchy and navigate to Kitbashery > Smart GameObject If a Smart Manager is not in the scene one will be automatically created.

Alternatively on an existing GameObject you can navigate to Add Component > Kitbashery > Gameplay > Smart GameObject and add it as a component.

Make sure there is a Smart Manager present in any scene with a SmartGameObject in it.

### Built-in Documentation:
Detailed instructions can be found by clicking the (?) button under the component's header for each component or component section.

Nearly every field will have a tooltip if you hover over it as well.
