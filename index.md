# Kitbashery

Kitbashery creates and maintains a collection of professionally developed and maintained game assets for Unity as a freemium service.

## Why Freemium?

<b>After years of working in Unity with thousands of dollars invested in the Unity Asset Store both as a publisher and consumer I found that:</b>

* It is unsustainable for most asset publishers to offer unlimited free suport and feature updates for life.
* The consumer could receive a broken, unsupported or close source asset no matter the inital price tag.
* Paid upgrades split the user base and don't have a "try before you buy" option.
* Updates to assets could take weeks to months for the asset store's review process to complete.

<b>So Kitbashery makes sure that:</b>

* Assets are free of an initial charge. No more paying for expensive broken assets you can't refund.
* If you like the asset then you can tip or pay what you want later.
* Assets & documentation are open-source and can be maintained in case the main developer suddenly kicks the bucket.
* Long term maintenance and support funded via a crowdfunding subscription model.
* Feature requests/new assets are developed on a per commission basis (or added by the community).
* The latest version is always available to download.


## Where to Download Assets?

1. The Unity Asset Store will have packages for the current Unity LTS version.
2. The most recent version can be downloaded from the asset's product page on this site.
3. Legacy versions can be found in the asset's GitHub repository's Releases tab.
4. Assets can be downloaded from Kitbashery's Ko-Fi store for free or you can "pay what you want".

Assets download from the Unity Asset Store will be automatically added to Unity's package manager.

When downloading from sources other than the Asset Store you will receive a .unitypackage file can be dragged into your project files and imported manually. Packages can also be imported into the package manager via its github address so updates can be tracked.
