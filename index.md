# Kitbashery

Kitbashery creates and maintains a collection of Unity assets as a freemium service.

## Why Freemium?

After years of working in Unity with thousands of dollars invested in the Unity Asset Store both as a publisher and consumer I found that:

* It is unsustainable for most asset publishers to offer unlimited free suport and feature updates for life.
* The consumer could be left with a broken, unsupported or close source asset no matter the inital price tag.
* Paid upgrades split the user base and don't have a "try before you buy" option.

So Kitbashery was created to:

* Provide assets free of an initial charge. No more paying for expensive broken assets.
* If you like the asset then you can tip or pay what you want later.
* Assets & documentation are open-source and can be maintained in case the main developer suddenly kicks the bucket.
* Official support is provided via a crowdfunding subscription model.
* Feature requests/new assets are developed on a per commission basis. (or added by the community)
